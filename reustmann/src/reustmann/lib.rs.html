<span class='doccomment'>//! ## Overview</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! The Reustmann machine is a tiny programming language and abstract processing</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! engine designed for educational use for experimentation with automatic program generation.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! It has the following properties:</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! - Any bit pattern in Reustmann memory is a legal Reustmann program – there are no instruction faults</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! - All operations address existing memory – there are no memory faults</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! - Reustmann source code consists of a string of characters, one character per instruction</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! A corollary is that any string of random characters is the source code for a legal,</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! executable Reustmann program.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! This allows, for example, a genetic algorithm to use an Reustmann program in source form as its genome,</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! evolving the source code string until the Reustmann program produces the desired output.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! ## Architecture</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! The Reustmann abstract machine is a Von Neumann architecture where all memory</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! locations are accessed through a program counter (**PC**) or stack pointer (**SP**).</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! The machine architecture can be characterized as a processor with three special-purpose registers (**PC**, **SP**, and **NZ** flag),</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! **L** memory locations (&quot;words&quot;) **W** bits wide, and an instruction set of about 40 opcodes.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! All possible states of memory and registers comprise legal Reustmann programs</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! – there is no possibility of an illegal instruction or a memory fault.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! Allowing all possible bit patterns to result in legal (but not necessarily interesting)</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! programs simplifies experimentation with automatic program generation.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! AI programs, such as neural nets and genetic algorithms,</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! can regard Reustmann programs as arbitrary bit patterns, evaluate them with an Reustmann simulator,</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! and compare the results against some fitness metric, without concern for syntactic program correctness.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! The Reustmann language is similar to a rudimentary assembly language.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! Reustmann source code can be expressed using either long or short mnemonics.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! Here is a simple Reustmann program that copies its input to its output as long as</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! the data is nonzero, shown with long mnemonics with added comments:</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! ```ignore</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! LOOP    // loop until the ENDL opcode</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! IN      // read one char from stdin and push it on the stack</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! BNZ     // skip the next instruction if nonzero</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! HALT    // HALT</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! OUT     // pop a word from the stack and write it to stdout</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! ENDL    // loop forever</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! ```</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! All memory addressing is through the stack pointer (**SP**) and is implied in each instruction,</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! so there are no operands specified in the source code.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! Using the short mnemonics, each Reustmann instruction can be represented by a single character,</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! and is the preferred format for entering and saving programs.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! The sample program above is represented in source code form using short mnemonics as the string:</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! `LIzHO]`</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! An Reustmann abstract machine contains **L** memory locations, **W** bits wide, where</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! `1 ≤ L ≤ 2^32` and `6 ≤ W ≤ 32`.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! This Reustmann architecture specifies a set of possible abstract machines,</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! where the rank of a machine is determined by unique combinations of **L** and **W**.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! An Reustmann program runs differently on machines of different ranks.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! For example, an Reustmann program that runs correctly on an abstract machine</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! of rank `L = 16`, `W = 16` will not necessarily produce the same results on a machine</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! with rank `L = 20`, `W = 8`.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! ## Memory and addressing model</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! The **L** words of memory are addressed as locations 0 through **L** – 1.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! The Stack Pointer (**SP**) seamlessly wraps around, treating the entire</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! address space as a circular buffer. Address calculations relating to the</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! Program Counter (**PC**) (e.g., branch targets) are performed using unsigned 32-bit</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! arithmetic and then adjusted if necessary to fit in the range [0 .. **L**).</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! When the **PC** would have been advanced to address A where A &gt; **L**, the address is</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! immediately readjusted to the address modulo **L**. This implies that it is</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! impossible to address a non-existent memory location.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! Each memory location can store unsigned values in the range [0 .. 2 **W**).</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! The memory locations are all writable. Instruction opcodes are stored in</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! memory by their numeric values as defined below.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! ## Execution model</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! After machine reset, the three Reustmann registers have these initial values,</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! and are described in more detail in a later section.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! `PC = 0`, `SP = 0` and `NZ = false`</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! For each simulation cycle, if the value at the memory location indexed by</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! **PC** is a defined opcode number, the opcode is executed in simulation</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! as described in the tables below. If the memory location indexed by **PC**</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! is not a defined opcode number, it is executed as if it were a NOP opcode.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! This implies there are no instruction faults.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! ## Input and Output</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! The Reustmann instruction set has one IN and one OUT instruction.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! These are character-oriented, regardless of the</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! value of **W**. Each time an IN instruction is executed, one character is</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! consumed from a user-specified input string or stream and pushed onto the</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! Reustmann stack, narrowing or widening the value to **W** bits. Each OUT</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! instruction pops the top of the Reustmann stack, casts the value to a (char)</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! type, and sends it to the abstract output stream.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! ## Source Code Representation</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! For Reustmann machines of rank **W** ≤ 8, the preferred source code format</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! is a string of characters of length ≤ L. When loaded into Reustmann memory,</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! the source string S is interpreted as follows:</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! ```ignore</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! for each character C in S:</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!     if C is a defined short mnemonic:</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!         store the opcode by opcode number</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!     else</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!         store the character value narrowed to W bits</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! ```</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! When a short-mnemonic source code disassembly is generated by an Reustmann abstract</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! machine of any rank, the listing will render each memory value N as a</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! single character as follows:</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! ```ignore</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! if N is an assigned opcode number:</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!     show the short opcode mnemonic</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! else if N is representable as a single character:</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!     show the literal character</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! else:</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!     show a &#39;;&#39; (NOP) opcode</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! ```</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! ### PC – Program Counter</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! The program counter **PC** contains a value in the range [0 .. **L**).</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! Values wrap around the address space, such that when the instruction execution</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! reaches the end of memory, execution by default continues at location zero.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! After machine reset, the **PC** starts at zero, and by default, is incremented</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! by one after each instruction is executed. If any branching or looping opcode</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! results in a calculated address outside the range [0 .. **L**), the address is changed</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! to the calculated address modulo **L** so that it always refers to a valid memory location.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! ## SP – Stack Pointer</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! The stack pointer **SP** contains a value in the range [0 .. **L**).</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! Values wrap around, so that the entire memory becomes a circular buffer for the **SP**.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! After machine reset, the **SP** starts at zero, and always points at the last item</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! stacked (the “top” of the stack). The **SP** grows toward lower addresses.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! If the **SP** changes to an address outside the range [0 .. **L**),</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! it is changed to the value modulo **L** so that it always refers to a valid memory location.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! This implies that the first item pushed onto the stack after machine reset</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! will be written to the top of memory at location **L**-1, and the new **SP**</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! will contain the value **L**-1 and will grow downward from there.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! ## NZ – Non-Zero Flag</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! The non-zero flag **NZ** reflects the non-zeroness of the most recent instruction</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! that read or wrote memory, as defined in the details below. **NZ** = true</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! means that the result was nonzero. The **NZ** flag can be tested with</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! the BZ and BNZ instructions. On machine reset, **NZ** is initialized to false.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//!</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! ## Math</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! Values in memory are regarded as unsigned integers in the range [0 .. 2 **W**).</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! The arithmetic opcodes evaluate their operands as if using 32-bit unsigned</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! integers with the results truncated to the least significant **W** bits.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>//! See individual opcodes below for more details.</span>
