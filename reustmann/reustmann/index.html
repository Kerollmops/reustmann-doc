<h2 id='overview' class='section-header'><a href='#overview'>Overview</a></h2>
<p>The Reustmann machine is a tiny programming language and abstract processing
engine designed for educational use for experimentation with automatic program generation.
It has the following properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any bit pattern in Reustmann memory is a legal Reustmann program – there are no instruction faults</li>
<li>All operations address existing memory – there are no memory faults</li>
<li>Reustmann source code consists of a string of characters, one character per instruction</li>
</ul>

<p>A corollary is that any string of random characters is the source code for a legal,
executable Reustmann program.
This allows, for example, a genetic algorithm to use an Reustmann program in source form as its genome,
evolving the source code string until the Reustmann program produces the desired output.</p>

<h2 id='architecture' class='section-header'><a href='#architecture'>Architecture</a></h2>
<p>The Reustmann abstract machine is a Von Neumann architecture where all memory
locations are accessed through a program counter (<strong>PC</strong>) or stack pointer (<strong>SP</strong>).
The machine architecture can be characterized as a processor with three special-purpose registers (<strong>PC</strong>, <strong>SP</strong>, and <strong>NZ</strong> flag),
<strong>L</strong> memory locations (&quot;words&quot;) <strong>W</strong> bits wide, and an instruction set of about 40 opcodes.
All possible states of memory and registers comprise legal Reustmann programs
– there is no possibility of an illegal instruction or a memory fault.</p>

<p>Allowing all possible bit patterns to result in legal (but not necessarily interesting)
programs simplifies experimentation with automatic program generation.
AI programs, such as neural nets and genetic algorithms,
can regard Reustmann programs as arbitrary bit patterns, evaluate them with an Reustmann simulator,
and compare the results against some fitness metric, without concern for syntactic program correctness.</p>

<p>The Reustmann language is similar to a rudimentary assembly language.
Reustmann source code can be expressed using either long or short mnemonics.
Here is a simple Reustmann program that copies its input to its output as long as
the data is nonzero, shown with long mnemonics with added comments:</p>

<pre class='rust rust-example-rendered'>
<span class='ident'>LOOP</span>    <span class='comment'>// loop until the ENDL opcode</span>
<span class='ident'>IN</span>      <span class='comment'>// read one char from stdin and push it on the stack</span>
<span class='ident'>BNZ</span>     <span class='comment'>// skip the next instruction if nonzero</span>
<span class='ident'>HALT</span>    <span class='comment'>// HALT</span>
<span class='ident'>OUT</span>     <span class='comment'>// pop a word from the stack and write it to stdout</span>
<span class='ident'>ENDL</span>    <span class='comment'>// loop forever</span></pre>

<p>All memory addressing is through the stack pointer (<strong>SP</strong>) and is implied in each instruction,
so there are no operands specified in the source code.
Using the short mnemonics, each Reustmann instruction can be represented by a single character,
and is the preferred format for entering and saving programs.
The sample program above is represented in source code form using short mnemonics as the string:</p>

<p><code>LIzHO]</code></p>

<p>An Reustmann abstract machine contains <strong>L</strong> memory locations, <strong>W</strong> bits wide, where</p>

<p><code>1 ≤ L ≤ 2^32</code> and <code>6 ≤ W ≤ 32</code>.</p>

<p>This Reustmann architecture specifies a set of possible abstract machines,
where the rank of a machine is determined by unique combinations of <strong>L</strong> and <strong>W</strong>.
An Reustmann program runs differently on machines of different ranks.
For example, an Reustmann program that runs correctly on an abstract machine
of rank <code>L = 16</code>, <code>W = 16</code> will not necessarily produce the same results on a machine
with rank <code>L = 20</code>, <code>W = 8</code>.</p>

<h2 id='memory-and-addressing-model' class='section-header'><a href='#memory-and-addressing-model'>Memory and addressing model</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>L</strong> words of memory are addressed as locations 0 through <strong>L</strong> – 1.
The Stack Pointer (<strong>SP</strong>) seamlessly wraps around, treating the entire
address space as a circular buffer. Address calculations relating to the
Program Counter (<strong>PC</strong>) (e.g., branch targets) are performed using unsigned 32-bit
arithmetic and then adjusted if necessary to fit in the range [0 .. <strong>L</strong>).
When the <strong>PC</strong> would have been advanced to address A where A &gt; <strong>L</strong>, the address is
immediately readjusted to the address modulo <strong>L</strong>. This implies that it is
impossible to address a non-existent memory location.</p>

<p>Each memory location can store unsigned values in the range [0 .. 2 <strong>W</strong>).
The memory locations are all writable. Instruction opcodes are stored in
memory by their numeric values as defined below.</p>

<h2 id='execution-model' class='section-header'><a href='#execution-model'>Execution model</a></h2>
<p>After machine reset, the three Reustmann registers have these initial values,
and are described in more detail in a later section.</p>

<p><code>PC = 0</code>, <code>SP = 0</code> and <code>NZ = false</code></p>

<p>For each simulation cycle, if the value at the memory location indexed by
<strong>PC</strong> is a defined opcode number, the opcode is executed in simulation
as described in the tables below. If the memory location indexed by <strong>PC</strong>
is not a defined opcode number, it is executed as if it were a NOP opcode.
This implies there are no instruction faults.</p>

<h2 id='input-and-output' class='section-header'><a href='#input-and-output'>Input and Output</a></h2>
<p>The Reustmann instruction set has one IN and one OUT instruction.
These are character-oriented, regardless of the
value of <strong>W</strong>. Each time an IN instruction is executed, one character is
consumed from a user-specified input string or stream and pushed onto the
Reustmann stack, narrowing or widening the value to <strong>W</strong> bits. Each OUT
instruction pops the top of the Reustmann stack, casts the value to a (char)
type, and sends it to the abstract output stream.</p>

<h2 id='source-code-representation' class='section-header'><a href='#source-code-representation'>Source Code Representation</a></h2>
<p>For Reustmann machines of rank <strong>W</strong> ≤ 8, the preferred source code format
is a string of characters of length ≤ L. When loaded into Reustmann memory,
the source string S is interpreted as follows:</p>

<pre class='rust rust-example-rendered'>
<span class='kw'>for</span> <span class='ident'>each</span> <span class='ident'>character</span> <span class='ident'>C</span> <span class='kw'>in</span> <span class='ident'>S</span>:
    <span class='kw'>if</span> <span class='ident'>C</span> <span class='ident'>is</span> <span class='ident'>a</span> <span class='ident'>defined</span> <span class='ident'>short</span> <span class='ident'>mnemonic</span>:
        <span class='ident'>store</span> <span class='ident'>the</span> <span class='ident'>opcode</span> <span class='ident'>by</span> <span class='ident'>opcode</span> <span class='ident'>number</span>
    <span class='kw'>else</span>
        <span class='ident'>store</span> <span class='ident'>the</span> <span class='ident'>character</span> <span class='ident'>value</span> <span class='ident'>narrowed</span> <span class='ident'>to</span> <span class='ident'>W</span> <span class='ident'>bits</span></pre>

<p>When a short-mnemonic source code disassembly is generated by an Reustmann abstract
machine of any rank, the listing will render each memory value N as a
single character as follows:</p>

<pre class='rust rust-example-rendered'>
<span class='kw'>if</span> <span class='ident'>N</span> <span class='ident'>is</span> <span class='ident'>an</span> <span class='ident'>assigned</span> <span class='ident'>opcode</span> <span class='ident'>number</span>:
    <span class='ident'>show</span> <span class='ident'>the</span> <span class='ident'>short</span> <span class='ident'>opcode</span> <span class='ident'>mnemonic</span>
<span class='kw'>else</span> <span class='kw'>if</span> <span class='ident'>N</span> <span class='ident'>is</span> <span class='ident'>representable</span> <span class='kw'>as</span> <span class='ident'>a</span> <span class='ident'>single</span> <span class='ident'>character</span>:
    <span class='ident'>show</span> <span class='ident'>the</span> <span class='ident'>literal</span> <span class='ident'>character</span>
<span class='kw'>else</span>:
    <span class='ident'>show</span> <span class='ident'>a</span> <span class='string'>&#39;;&#39;</span> (<span class='ident'>NOP</span>) <span class='ident'>opcode</span></pre>

<h3 id='pc--program-counter' class='section-header'><a href='#pc--program-counter'>PC – Program Counter</a></h3>
<p>The program counter <strong>PC</strong> contains a value in the range [0 .. <strong>L</strong>).
Values wrap around the address space, such that when the instruction execution
reaches the end of memory, execution by default continues at location zero.
After machine reset, the <strong>PC</strong> starts at zero, and by default, is incremented
by one after each instruction is executed. If any branching or looping opcode
results in a calculated address outside the range [0 .. <strong>L</strong>), the address is changed
to the calculated address modulo <strong>L</strong> so that it always refers to a valid memory location.</p>

<h2 id='sp--stack-pointer' class='section-header'><a href='#sp--stack-pointer'>SP – Stack Pointer</a></h2>
<p>The stack pointer <strong>SP</strong> contains a value in the range [0 .. <strong>L</strong>).
Values wrap around, so that the entire memory becomes a circular buffer for the <strong>SP</strong>.
After machine reset, the <strong>SP</strong> starts at zero, and always points at the last item
stacked (the “top” of the stack). The <strong>SP</strong> grows toward lower addresses.
If the <strong>SP</strong> changes to an address outside the range [0 .. <strong>L</strong>),
it is changed to the value modulo <strong>L</strong> so that it always refers to a valid memory location.
This implies that the first item pushed onto the stack after machine reset
will be written to the top of memory at location <strong>L</strong>-1, and the new <strong>SP</strong>
will contain the value <strong>L</strong>-1 and will grow downward from there.</p>

<h2 id='nz--non-zero-flag' class='section-header'><a href='#nz--non-zero-flag'>NZ – Non-Zero Flag</a></h2>
<p>The non-zero flag <strong>NZ</strong> reflects the non-zeroness of the most recent instruction
that read or wrote memory, as defined in the details below. <strong>NZ</strong> = true
means that the result was nonzero. The <strong>NZ</strong> flag can be tested with
the BZ and BNZ instructions. On machine reset, <strong>NZ</strong> is initialized to false.</p>

<h2 id='math' class='section-header'><a href='#math'>Math</a></h2>
<p>Values in memory are regarded as unsigned integers in the range [0 .. 2 <strong>W</strong>).
The arithmetic opcodes evaluate their operands as if using 32-bit unsigned
integers with the results truncated to the least significant <strong>W</strong> bits.
See individual opcodes below for more details.</p>
